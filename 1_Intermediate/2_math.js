Number constants
Here are some of the built-in number constants that exist on the Math object: 

1.The PI number: Math.PI which is approximately 3.14159

2.The Euler's constant: Math.E which is approximately 2.718

3.The natural logarithm of 2: Math.LN2 which is approximately 0.693

Rounding methods
These include: 

 1.Math.ceil() - rounds up to the closest integer 

 2.Math.floor() - rounds down to the closest integer 

 3.Math.round() - rounds up to the closest integer if the decimal is .5 or above; otherwise, rounds down to the closest integer 

 4.Math.trunc() - trims the decimal, leaving only the integer

Arithmetic and calculus methods
Here is a non-conclusive list of some common arithmetic and calculus methods that exist on the Math object: 

1.Math.pow(2,3) - calculates the number 2 to the power of 3, the result is 8 

2.Math.sqrt(16) - calculates the square root of 16, the result is 4 

3.Math.cbrt(8) - finds the cube root of 8, the result is 2 

4.Math.abs(-10) - returns the absolute value, the result is 10 

5.Logarithmic methods: Math.log(), Math.log2(), Math.log10() 

Return the minimum and maximum values of all the inputs: Math.min(9,8,7) returns 7, Math.max(9,8,7) returns 9.

 Trigonometric methods: Math.sin(), Math.cos(), Math.tan(), etc.
